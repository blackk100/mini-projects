# Mini Projects
A bunch of random stuff I made a long while ago.

Only runs on Windows (obviously).

For maximun effect:
1. Run the batch file (won't kill your computer, you can look at the code).
2. Right-click on the Title Bar.
3. Goto the Layout tab.
4. Under Screen Buffer Size, set:
  * Width: 170 (DO NOT CHANGE THIS)
  * Height: 9999 (Can be changed)
5. Under Window Size, set:
  * Width: Your choice, but keep it under 170 (Screen Buffer Size Width)
  * Height: Your choice, no strict restrictions
6. Click on OK, and enjoy (don't maximize, it causes a static line of numbers to be displayed on the bottom)

**Run these programs at your own risk, they can cause epilectic attacks. I do not take any responsibilty for any damage or injury that these programs may cause toy yo, a bystander, or even your device for that matter.**
